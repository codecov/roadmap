# Codecov's Roadmap
A repo for work specific to the product team of Codecov. Some of these issues may filter into the Codecov roadmap, but won't be worked in the same fashion as an engineering issue. 
If you have questions about anything you see in this repo, feel free to reach out to @aj-codecov or @rohan-at-sentry directly!
